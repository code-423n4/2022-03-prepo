FYI some of us could be participating as a team, will we each person in the team be given an NFT, or must we fractionalise it ourselves? 😂😂

Each person will get one :)

Hi PrePO team, really cool project you have here! Is the base token that will be deposited for PreCT going to be USDC? So there’s only one path into obtaining PreCT?


[17-Mar-22 05:09 PM] mlohc137#6239
Going to include @Xavier | prePO 🔮 on this, but yes the idea is for launch we are most likely going to be sticking with USDC. 

The `Collateral` vault was originally designed with the intention of using a 18 decimal token like DAI, and we recognize that there will need to be some slight modification to accommodate the 6 decimal precision of USDC.

Hi ! In SingleStrategyController what would be an example strategy ?


[18-Mar-22 10:45 AM] Pedroais#1630
Could the strategy deposit collateral into various protocols? Is that out of scope for the contest ?


[18-Mar-22 11:00 AM] Pedroais#1630
Could a strategy potentially lose money ?


[18-Mar-22 11:10 AM] mlohc137#6239
The `Strategy` itself is outside of the scope of this contest, but for the purposes of analyzing the `SingleStrategyController` and `Collateral` vault, you could imagine in its place perhaps a simple contract that simply lends `USDC` on AAVE or deposits into a Yearn vault for yield.

So yes, a strategy could potentially incur a loss.


[19-Mar-22 06:16 AM] berndartmueller#1928
Hello, what's the point of having both an `_allowedAccounts` and `_blockedAccounts` access control in `AccountAccessController.sol`?


[19-Mar-22 06:30 AM] Xavier | prePO 🔮#8980
by default, no one is allowed. a user can change themselves to allowed if they can show that theyre in the merkle tree of allowed addresses.
but any address on the block list will be blocked regardless of whether theyre allowed or not. this means we can individually block without needing to update the whole merkle tree again.
feel free to DM me for further questions/clarifications!
